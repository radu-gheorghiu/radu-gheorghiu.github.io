# **Watch out for Julia**

I first heard of Julia from Kaggle’s [“First Steps With Julia”](https://www.kaggle.com/c/street-view-getting-started-with-julia) competition and started looking around some of its features while on [julialang.org](http://julialang.org/) and at that point I thought that it was maybe a replacement for R or even a more hardcore version of R developed especially for scientists.


But recently I read a blog post from Microsoft’s [Cortana Intelligence and Machine Learning Blog](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning) on Julia – [“Julia – A Fresh Approach to Numerical Computing”](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2017/01/31/julia-a-fresh-approach-to-numerical-computing/) and I have to say that I feel like the tide will turn in a year or so and we will see a rapid adoption of Julia in the Machine Learning community.

The blog post from Microsoft’s blog was authored by one of Julia’s co-creators, Viral B. Shah, who pointed one of Julia’s major promises, the one to eliminate the so-called “two language problem” where you would use one high-level language for prototyping and drop down into C code in order to squeeze maximum performance for the production code.

Julia overcomes this because there is no penalty in terms of performance for using either high-level or abstract constructs, essentially bridging the gap of coding differences between an engineer and a researcher.

There are many more good things to be read about Julia, like GPU support for ML just to name one. I recommend reading the articles linked in this post for more information.
